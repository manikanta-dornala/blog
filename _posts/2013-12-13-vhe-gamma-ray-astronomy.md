In order to study the various processes and objects of the universe, electromagnetic radiation and particles emitted from them act as information messenger. But to observe all these radiation and particles directly is very seldom as most of them get deflected or interrupted by interstellar medium or other objects. As gamma rays are very less affected by these interactions, they are a very good source of information about the source object. The direction, energy and temporal spread of these rays reveal the important information about the processes going on at these sources.

## Sources of Gamma ray

### A. Supernova and Supernova Remanants
Supernovae are energetic stellar explosions that are usually triggered in a variety of ways. They play a critical role in high energy astrophysics for many reasons, among them the production of heavy elements, the formation of new stars, and the acceleration of cosmic rays. Some are also used as standard candles for measurements of distance on the cosmological scale.

### Crab Nebula

The Crab nebula is a SNR of a Type II supernova, and is one of the most studied sources of EM radiation in the universe. The Crab nebula shows some variability in the 1 to 150 MeV range. However, from 300 Gev to 3TeV, the Crab nebula has a steady flux of radiation, and is considered as a standard candle using which telescopes are calibrated.

### B. Active Galactic Nuclei
An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy that has much
higher luminosity, at least in some portion of electromagnetic spectrum. Such excess emission
has been observed in Radio, Infrared, Optical, Ultra-violet, X-ray and Gamma Ray wave bands.

### Markarian 421

Markarian421 under study is a blazar, located in the constellation Ursa Major, estimated to be
at a distance from us of around distance of ∼ 134.1 Mpc (H = 71 km s−1 Mpc−1 , Ωm = 0.27, Ωλ
= 0.73). It was first determined to be a very high energy gamma ray emitter, found to be
emitting radiation in the TeV energies, in 1992 by M. Punch at the Whipple Observatory, and
an extremely rapid outburst in very high energy gamma rays (15-minute rise-time) was
measured in 1996 by J. Gaidos at Whipple Observatory.

It is one of the closest blazars to Earth,
making it one of the brightest quasars in the night sky. It is suspected to have a super massive black hole (SMBH) at its center due to its active nature, and has a companion galaxy
(Markarian 421-5) that is fueling the gas jets observed pointing away from the galaxy.
It has been seen that the TeV γ-ray emission from Mrk421 is highly variable with variations of
more than one order of magnitude and occasional flaring doubling time of as short as 15
minutes.
...

Lets skip all of this,

### How does a gamma ray interact with our atmosphere?

For the most part of its journey, from the source to us, it was uninterrupted. But our atmosphere in this matter is a behemoth. It completely destroys the gamma ray particle. But luckily we can still know if a gamma ray particle has ever entered! The thing is, although the gamma ray dies off, it leaves a finger print in its wake.

## Formation of Extensive Air showers
As the gamma ray struck the earth’s atmosphere, it undergoes pair production forming electron and
positron.  This
occurs at an altitude of 20km. The resultant electron and positron pair carries the total energy of the
incident gamma ray. After traversing about a radiation length, these positrons and electrons undergo
bremsstrahlung to emit gamma rays which further undergo pair production after another radiation
length.

In this way, a shower of charged particles falling down at a small angle to the initial direction
of incident gamma ray is formed. This shower is known as Extensive Air Shower. The process
continues down through the atmosphere with the number of charges particles increasing till their
energy drops to a point where ionization losses and radiation losses become equal. This point is known
as the shower maximum. From this point onwards, the cascade of charged particles dies off.

Seems messy? Probably this image will help you !

Guess what! All electrons and protons moving at relativistic speeds in the atmosphere emit <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation" >Cherenkov radiation.</a>
This Cherenkov radiation can be easily detected using simple light detectors and hence can be used to
generate an image of the shower.

The shower retains the original direction of the gamma ray as when
the shower is back traced, it converges to the point of origin of shower where the incident gamma ray underwent pair production. Hence the original direction of the gamma ray can be easily traced to
determine the source of the gamma ray in the sky.

Further, the number of Cherenkov photons emitted
is directly proportional to the initial energy of gamma ray revealing more information about the
source. The Cherenkov light arrives at the detector within a span of a few nanoseconds, so the time of
arrival of the incident gamma ray can also be recorded to a high precision.

## Imaging of Cherenkov radiation

The Cherenkov radiation coming from the Extensive Air Shower is collected by the ground based
telescopes to get the image of the shower and hence information about the incident gamma ray.


### Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique Telescope details

The telescope is a simple combination of a light collecting system using a mirror reflector, a
light detecting system at its focal plane and fast pulse counting electronic system attached to it.
Atmosphere, though out of control regime, plays a crucial role in this technique as it acts as a
large calorimeter. The gamma rays end up in Extensive Air Showers which can be detected by
ground based detectors.

Generally Davis-Cotton design is implemented to collect the Cherenkov radiation from the
extensive air shower. The tessellated arrays of spherical mirror of same focal length provides
larger mirror collection area.

On the focal plane, there is generally an array of Photo Multiplier Tubes to detect the light
signals. PMT works on the principle of photoelectric effect. The falling light emits
photoelectrons at the photocathode plate. These primary electrons are focused to pass through
many channels which multiply their number by around 4 each time they pass through them.
Hence, in the end, 10 5 – 10 6 electrons reach the collector pin and generate a small pulse of
current.

An array of such PMTs is used to capture the image of the Cherenkov light pulse. They have a
quantum efficiency of around 15%. Drawback of using PMTs is that they get easily damaged by
bright light.

## Image extraction and Identifying Gamma Rays

After getting the number of photons in each PMT (pixel) detected for each event, we need to
process this numbers to identify the image of the extensive air showers in the array. In case of
TACTIC, a 12-bit number is received from each PMT. The image processing involves three
processes:-

 1. Calibration

 2. Night Sky Background Removal

 3. Image Identification (Peel subtraction)

### Image Parameterization
In order to analyze the images, which otherwise are just abstract patches, we parameterize them. The following parameters are computed for every detected image of interest.

 1. Size (S)

 2. Length (L)

 3. Width (W)

 4. Distance (D)

 5. Alpha (α)

 6. Asymmetry (As)

 7. Concentration or Frac2 (F2)

 8. Miss (M)

 9. Azimuthal Width

 10. Azimuthal Angle (ɸ)

 11. Number of Pixels


One can think of these 11 parameters as feature descriptors of the images. We can now analytically place cuts on various parameters to identify/filter gamma ray detection incidents from background (Cosmic rays)
