excerpt: "I'm a Research Assitant at Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab at Georgia Tech lead by <a href='http://www.munmund.net/' target='_blank'>Dr. Munmun De Choudhury</a>. My current work involves applying natural language processing and statistical machine learning techniques to analyze large scale social media data to understand behavioral aspects of mental health of beings. At the moment I'm trying to make sense of loads of LinkedIn data from various employees and understand their Role Ambiguity and its relationship to the stress they are put under in their work places.

    <h3 class="centered"><b>Data Analysis & ML</b></h3>
        <p>My favorite <i>idle time</i> activity. I find it really soothing to find patterns in everything? The ecstatic feeling you're left with, when your machine learns something better than you do, is worth all the pain and time. I always work on some short projects/ assignments, look them up!</p>

        <h3 class="centered"><b>Complex Systems</b></h3>
        <p>I have been really getting into modeling and simulations of various physical processes. Its just something I keep doing these days. Whether it cellular automatas or simple linear models I'm drawn towards simulating them and analyze their behaviors in different settings and interpret them.</p>
        <!-- <h3 class="centered"><b>& Image Processing</b></h3> -->
        <!-- <p>Image processing and computer vision are interesting topics! Although it takes time, some algorithms are way over the place. I was trying to segment nerves in ultra sound images. That was quite interesting!</p> -->

        <h3 class="centered"><b>Astro Physics</b></h3>
        <p>I like the dark skies a lot. I spend many nights, just lying there and watch them stars twinkle. I also like cosmology, stellar statistics and studying the large-scale structure of the universe!</p>

        <h3 class="centered"><b>Music</b></h3>
        <p>I've a really diverse taste in music, mostly electronic pop. I find it really relaxing to plug in my earphones and dream with volume on full. Stalk me here on <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/ManikantaReddy/" target="_blank"><b>last.fm</b></a> to see if we match.</p>

        <p>
            I can cook too. When I've nothing else to do, you can always find me in the kitchen cooking delicious food and mostly eating it on my own, that explains why I'm so chubby. If I ever invite you over, trust me, your tastebuds are in for a treat.

        <p>Besides all of that, I like to cycle, walk randomly and bump into people. I also happen to trek, <i>sometimes</i>, and like to go places.</p>
