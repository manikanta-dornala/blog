<p><a href="http://www.hchw.in" target="_blank">HCHW</a> is an NGO that works for often neglected and marginalized urban and rural populations. One of their ventures drives mobile clinics, that provide medical facilities by taking the clinics to the masses. A team of a few engineers from Microsoft is empowering them with technology by digitalizing their frontier, allowing them to expand quickly. I had the fortune to offer my skills to build an online portal for the mobile clinics, with plenty of learnings in working with Angular, .NET, Entity Framework, SQL Server, Azure</p>
