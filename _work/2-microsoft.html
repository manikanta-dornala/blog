I worked for Core Services Engineering (CSE) with the Customer Account Life Cycle (CALC) tool, that serves the sales personnel of Microsoft and ensures they generate revenue as quickly as possible. I delivered mission-critical systems that generate large amounts of data capable of directly influencing key decision makers of the company and incentive compensation of sellers.
