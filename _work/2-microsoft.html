I was working on an Internal business tool called Customer Account Life Cycle (CALC) tool, that serves the sales personnel of Microsoft and ensures they generate revenue as quickly as possible. I delivered mission-critical systems that generate large amounts of data capable of directly influencing key decision makers of the company and incentive compensation of sellers. 

    + One awesome thing I did was to design and build a highly scalable API leveraging Azure architecture that brought down a business process from *2 weeks to 5 days* with 0.1% inconsistencies churning more than **25 million requests** in that short period of time. It was pretty damn cool.
